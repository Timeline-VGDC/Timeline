# Timeline

Timeline is a project started in Fall of 2021 by a group of students in CSU Fullerton's Video Game Development Club. This is our collective efforts over the past semester. 

Timeline is a puzzle game where the player is tasked with helping a man named Leo escape from his childhood home. At first glance, this task seems simple enough, but dig under the surface and you'll find there's a lot more going on than meets the eye. [This demo](https://carthage-411.itch.io/timeline-demo) will allow you to play through the first level of the game and explore some of the basic story developed for the game.
